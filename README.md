# hwOneCSS

For this HW, I went through the HTML first to try to understand what groupings could be consolidated and what was unique. I also replaced a number of divs with semantic elements.

Then, I went through the CSS and tried to consolidate as much as I could, and re-ordered it so it was easier to follow. I added comments to explain what governs what.
